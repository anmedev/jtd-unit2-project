## Description
This repository contains my code for the Unit 2 project in the Treehouse Jvaa Techdegree curriculum. This project uses Java to create a soccer league organizer, which provides various options for a user to choose from. Users can create a team, add and remove players from a team, view a team's roster, view a team's height report, as well as view a league balance report, which displays the number of experienced vs. inexperienced members of a team.
